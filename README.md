This example demonstrates a common JavaScript pitfall: type coercion leading to unexpected string concatenation.  The `foo` function intends to add two numbers, but due to JavaScript's loose typing, when a number and a string are used as parameters, the '+' operator performs string concatenation instead of numerical addition. The solution shows how to explicitly type check or use parseInt to force numerical operations.
